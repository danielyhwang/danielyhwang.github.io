> Third time's the charm... 

I've struggled for a while to figure out what my GitHub username should be. I was once inSaneSyntax (my high school username), then whydaniel (based off a joke from extended family that I think only like one or two people got), and finally I changed it to danielyhwang. Once I did, I finally created this website. I tried creating a personal blog called whydaniel.github.io to detail my experiences as a freelance programmer (which resulted in a small project called Nugget Loves You); it also served as my introduction to GitHub pages. I then got to Georgia Tech and created a personal site called sites.gatech.edu/danielyhwang in an hour so I could get class credit. And now I created danielyhwang.github.io after finally finding the perfect Jekyll theme to use for my website, [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

Completion of this blog took roughly half a week and mainly included
<ul>
    <li> Downloading Docker and reinstalling Jekyll</li>
    <li> Redoing all of the pages, including retyping my CV on the website</li>
    <li> Filtering out all the pages I didn't want to include, in this case, a dropdown menu, a publications page (that will be for later), and a repos page (since I don't have too many public GitHub repos) </li>
    <li> Commenting out all the posts on the blog other than mine</li>
    <li> Typing up original content, including my first blog post and this page </li>
    <li> Adding in social connections via Giscus</li>
</ul>

Huh... I thought I'd take more time writing this post out, but I think I've said all I've wanted to say. I'm really impressed by this theme and how versatile and clean it is. As someone that enjoys more backend coding than frontend coding, having all the layout completed for me saved me a lot of time.

Here's to this website sticking out! I am proud of it.
