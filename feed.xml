I am now roughly halfway through the PhD program. 2024 was a very chaotic (*) year full of stress, overload, and breakdown, however, it has also been full of opportunities, moments of joy, and achievements.</p> <p><sub> (*) For the purposes of this blog post, I’m speaking about my <b>personal experiences</b> as a math graduate student, but I would be remiss to not mention the political turmoil overseas, especially in Ukraine, Israel/Palestine, Syria, and also domestically with our recent headache of an election. This has truly been a chaotic year that has tested the limits of our diplomacy and democracy, and we seem on track to stretch its limits and test its resiliency in the coming years. I admit I do not know much about how to go about this, but to put it simply, we’ll need to fight for each other.</sub></p> <p>I’ll start back in August 2023, because I consider the past three semesters to all have built up to the state I am currently facing. By this point, I had completed 5 classes, started to attend conferences in the area, and spent a summer visiting my family in Korea and interning at Los Alamos National Lab. So what did I do next? Well, I honestly have to break it up into multiple timelines.</p> <h2 id="academically">Academically</h2> <ul> <li>Third attempt on comps. Passed algebra, failed topology.</li> <li>Took differential topology and knot theory. Learned enough to pass the topology exam following semester, but decided it wasn’t for me. Oh yeah, I <strong>passed comps!</strong></li> <li>Began meeting with my now-advisor Josephine Yu about problems in Ehrhart Theory. <strong>Declared advisor</strong> in May. Continued working with my advisor and another student throughout 2024 to conduct primary research.</li> <li>Got overwhelmed in Spring 2024, barely pass one class in Tropical Geometry.</li> <li><strong>Finished my remaining course requirements in Fall 2024</strong> by passing Numerical Linear Algebra and Enumerative Combinatorics. I am now done with classes, in both senses of the word ``done”.</li> </ul> <h2 id="research">Research</h2> <ul> <li>Wrapped up my first internship project at Los Alamos.</li> <li>Joined a second internship project at Los Alamos for the summer of 2024, resulting in a <strong>paper approved for publication!</strong></li> <li><strong>Began PhD research</strong> with my advisor on Ehrhart Theory. We make some good observations and a list of future directions. However, I am stretched thin and unable to complete as much as I want/should.</li> </ul> <h2 id="volunteering-and-school-of-math-activities">Volunteering and School of Math activities</h2> <ul> <li>Spent 3 months as an event organizer for GT6000, Georgia Tech’s introduction to grad student life. A rewarding experience but also exhausting.</li> <li><strong>Spent 7 months as a primary coordinator for High School Math Day.</strong> As rewarding as that was, it was also exhausting and I have since entrusted HSMD to a capable team.</li> <li><strong>Elected as Graduate Student Representative</strong> and begin attending weekly commitee meetings. Also hosted a bunch of events as part of Grad Council in Fall 2024. <strong>This is the area in which I perhaps stretched myself the furthest in terms of my time.</strong> My terms continues until May of next year.</li> <li>Mentored two undergrad students as part of DRP! Thanks Graham and Richard for a great semester - I’m impressed by your curiosity and openness and hope you continue learning more in the future!</li> <li>At the peak of my busy schedule, I gave two different student lectures on the same day. Never doing that again. </li> </ul> <h2 id="travelling">Travelling</h2> <ul> <li>Gave a poster at CLSAC 2023 in Annapolis, Maryland, as part of Los Alamos duties. Also attended AMS Southeastern Sectional Fall 2023 in Mobile, Alabama!</li> <li>Attended the AMS Eastern Sectional Spring 2024 in Washington, DC and GTA Philadelphia at Temple University!</li> <li><strong>Attended ECCO 2024 in Popayan, Colombia!</strong> <a href="/blog/2024/ecco2024">I wrote a whole blog post about it!</a></li> <li>…and I hope to travel even more in 2025…</li> </ul> <h2 id="and-other-fun-things">And other fun things…</h2> <ul> <li>Attended all the conventions in Atlanta (DragonCon, MomoCon, Anime Weekend Atlanta)!</li> <li>Went on hikes to Stone Mountain, Sweetwater Creek, and Arabia Mountain in Georgia! Also went to Lake Tahoe with friends!</li> <li>Hung out with friends. Highlights include GT Football Games, gatherings at Emmy Squared, seeing Hamilton in February, music jams, and hosting my first ever party.</li> <li>Began improv comedy in Fall 2024 - I am now a member of <a href="https://letstrythis.org">Let’s Try This</a> and I look forward to Monday evenings doing improv :D. I also finally got around to doing a few open mics in 2024.</li> <li> <h3><b>My niece was born this year</b></h3> <p>and she brings so much joy to our now larger family.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="in-summary-burnout">In Summary, Burnout</h2> <p>As grateful as I am to have traveled the places I’ve gone, met the people I have, getting to do the things I’ve gotten to do, and helping those I helped, my schedule this year has led to a gradual and painful burnout that really kicked in around November. I’ve just been moving from place to place, task to task, project to project, and yeah, it was crushing. I’ve helped out a LOT of people in the School of Mathematics, finished my coursework and comp exams, started research, and even contributed to an accepted paper, but I’ve had too much on my plate for quite some time, as my close friends and family could (and would) point out obviously in retrospect. Do I regret having taken the speedrun route to finish out my remaining non-thesis requirements? Or do I regret having done the volunteer positions I’ve done? No. Were both of these things taxing? Absolutely. I’m grateful and proud to have done what I’ve done, but it has forced me to reconsider my work-life balance and to shift my priorities going into 2025. So what do I do?</p> <h2 id="plans-for-2025">Plans for 2025</h2> <p>Well, now that I’m done with classes, I’m trying to set a stricter work-life balance, and for me that roughly means:</p> <ul> <li>Morning: focus on Math research and nothing else. For Spring 2025 I’m going to attend a virtual class on computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, but that’s it for me personally other than my few other commitments (grad council, grad committee, teaching, algebra seminar) - I’m trying to keep them to a reasonable minimum.</li> <li>Afternoon: focus on self-care/writing. Try to exercise more (I got a bit lazy this semester) and fall in love with cooking again (it got taxing this year to take care of myself, but honestly that’s kinda what I need to do).</li> <li>Evening: focus on comedy. Go to open mics. Do more improv. Go to events with friends. Atlanta is a good city for this sort of stuff (music/theatre events). (EDIT: But also feel free to stay in if you need to…)</li> </ul> <p>I’m essentially making a bet on myself that instead of overloading my schedule with a bunch of different parallel topics, that if I just focus on one, even if it’s for half the normal time I would work, then I can make good progress. Especially since I’m in two creative fields (math and comedy) that both require time. I have been trying to rush myself for the past few years and now I’m a space where I don’t have to… so… I shouldn’t.</p> <p>And of course, more time with my family and niece is always appreciated. I am also trying to spend more time with friends and build up some friendships I might have lost.</p> <p>Finally, I am working on a travel/internship schedule for this year and I hope I’ll get to visit some cool places in the process.</p> <p>Here’s to 2025.</p> <p>We’re halfway there…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly"/><category term="yearly"/><category term="personal-update"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're Halfway There...

It took me 20 minutes alone to just figure out which photos I was gonna include on this post.</p> <p>As I mentioned on my previous post, yeah, I was basically scrambling to get everything together before leaving the US. Was I successful? Eh… partially. I got most everything done, but I finished packing up at 2AM on Saturday, June 15th, when I was set to fly out. I was definitely nervous before boarding the flight, and it didn’t help that I already lost some skin care products I had during TSA Checkpoint. But nonetheless, it was time to leave.</p> <h2 id="travel-atl---bog---clo---ppn">Travel ATL -&gt; BOG -&gt; CLO -&gt; PPN</h2> <p>So the actual travel process was very long. I arrived in Bogota at 7pm, got dinner with my friend I was travelling with, before meeting up with two of his friends. It was at this moment (as with many others) that I realized I don’t know Spanish well enough to hold a conversation. My high school classes were not giving me the knowledge I needed to speak conversationally. But nonetheless, the night went on, I went back to my hotel, went through Bogota airport, got my nail filer confiscated at TSA Checkpoint, and flew out to Cali. Afterwards, I got some camarones (shrimp) [see Figure 1] with my friend and proceeded to make it Cali Bus Terminal, where we booked a bus ride to Popayan, as planned. Unfortunately, the bus broke down in the middle of the road and the next few hours were rough. But we eventually made it. I met some others and had dinner with them, and then called it in a night.</p> <h2 id="week-1">Week 1</h2> <p>So I was not ready for the week ahead. Mainly that the hotel I stayed at was right next to a church and that church bells go off at 5AM, 6AM, and 7AM. I woke up on the 6AM ones. I eventually got out of my bed and ready for classes. We stopped by a local church [see Figure 2] on the way to the University. I made it my goal to try to talk to one new person each day, and as the days went on, it became easier and easier, and eventually I made a lot of friends through the classes, discussions, and lunches. For the classes, Isabella Novik talked about f-vectors and h-vectors, while Matthias Beck talked about good old Ehrhart Theory. The seminars and posters were great, and I was struggling to comprehend everything at once.</p> <p>After conference, that’s when it got fun. Monday we had a traditional opening ceremony where everyone was chatting over sweets and wine (I ended up buying a pizza afterwards due to hunger). Tuesday we had a salsa class, and trust me, after feeling exhausted at the end of the day, this was what I needed. It wasn’t really a salsa class, more just a jazzercise class, but hey, I like that too [see Figure 3]. We got drinks and food later at a local pub. I got arepas. Wednesday we did karaoke. Thursday there was the traditional ceremony, before that, I got ice cream, and during the ceremony, oh my god. We were treated to a traditional dance performance before the floor was open to us dancing, along with the traditional pipian (think of it if a sweet potato was salty) tamale, empanadas, pineapple juice with corn, and tons of aguardiente. I ended up playing a percussion instrument before the band leader invited me to take shots with him. This night was wild [see Figures 4a, 4b, 4c]. Friday I hung out with my Georgia Tech friend before he left the next day and went to a very overcrowded bar. Keep in mind that almost every night also had after-parties as well.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_16_shrimp-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_16_shrimp-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_16_shrimp-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024_06_16_shrimp.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_17_popayan_church-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_17_popayan_church-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_17_popayan_church-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024_06_17_popayan_church.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: Shrimp in Cali, right before the bus ride.

I took the rest of the evening easy given rain in the area. I took on Colombia’s take on English Breakfast, the Bandeja Paisa [see Figure 5]. It is huge. I thought I could eat it all. I was wrong.</p> <p>Sunday I woke up and did a tour of Popayan with my tour guide. Since the museums were closed, we ended up doing a hike up to Tres Cruces, literally translated as Three Crosses [see Figures 6 and 7]. I had some of the best lemonade (both sour and sweet at the right levels, reminded me more of tangerine than lemon) and ate a small lunch of a fried potato stuffed with rice. Beautiful. I went home, took a nap, got two dinners with friends (hey, I just happened to walk into a second group that wanted to get dinner as well), and prepared myself for the next day. Also, I had the salpicón payanés [see Figure 8], which is like an upgraded strawberry smoothie, and it was wonderful.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_22_bandeja_paisa-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_22_bandeja_paisa-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_22_bandeja_paisa-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024_06_22_bandeja_paisa.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_23_hike-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_23_hike-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_23_hike-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024_06_23_hike.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_23_tres_cruces-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_23_tres_cruces-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2024_06_23_tres_cruces-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024_06_23_tres_cruces.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 5: The bandeja paisa.

This week’s courses were taught by Hal Schenck (wanted to give a rough and very fast overview of toric varieties and h-vector theorem proof - I wish he had two weeks to teach, because he had a lot of intuitive ideas, just not enough time to process them) and Cynthia Vinzant (talked about matroids, log-concavity, and the famous theorem by Branden-Huh saying polynomial is completely log concanve if its corresponding Newton polygon is M-convex). Unfortunately, towards Wednesday (especially Wednesday since I got sick then), everyone started losing energy so by Friday we were barely processing. But I will be looking over problem sets and notes from these courses for some time after the conference. But enough about that, more fun things.</p> <p>Monday cheered on Colombia as they won against Paraguay and then watched Costa Rica tie against Brazil [see Figure 11]. I was also introduced to Colombian Fried Chicken aka Frisby’s. It’s good. Tuesday our group walked to the top of a hill nearby the university and we had a nice dinner afterwards [see Figures 12 and 13]. Wednesday I was sick, but I somehow felt energized enough to play volleyball and watch soccer with everyone [see Figure 14]. I ended up eating the Eduardo Santos (ice cream cake, local Popayan speciality) afterwards [see Figure 15]. Thursday the conference was winding down, but I had lunch with my friends [see Figure 16] and by the end, I had arepas for dinner and danced one last time with my friends.

I paid for my hotel, called a taxi, did problems one last time with some friends, ate lunch at my go-to spot nearby, shopped around for souvenirs, and then it was time to go. I played ping pong with phone paddles (random idea someone else came up with) before boarding a taxi and heading home. Unfortunately, the trip home (Popayan -&gt; Cali) was NOT smooth, as my bus broke down AGAIN and I ended up making it to the airport one hour to my flight (I was originally planning on getting there with 3). After an overnight layover in Bogota, I walked around the Bogota streets and just took in the air. I then made it to the airport, tried some soup and limonada de coco (reminds me of Milkis), and made it past TSA Security… I ended up losing my sunscreen and my anti-itch ointment. Said goodbye to another participant Felix on the way to my plane in Bogota Airport, and before I knew it (two movies later), I was back in Atlanta. Hot, sweaty, muggy Atlanta. This was at 11PM too how could it be THIS hot at 11PM?!</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>I didn’t even talk about the small moments I had, going to the church, walking through the streets at night, receiving a souvenir from a worker at the Popayan bus terminal (thank you Diana), eating chicarron ice cream, it’s too much to write. But I will just conclude by saying that this was one of the greatest experiences I could ever have as a graduate student and I finally felt by Day 1 of the conference that all the flight bookings, all the packing, all the nervousness I felt about going to a country that wasn’t the US or South Korea, was all worth it by the time I left. In particular, all the organizers and participants were friendly, approachable, supportive, and just in general fun to be around. I can keep talking more but my overall impression is yes, go to ECCO if you can, it’s amazing and I now understand the hype.</p> <p>Para concluir, gracias a Colombia, los participantes, y especialmente los organizadores por la comida, baila, canta, y los momentos inolvidables! (Durante este conferencia, mi español mejoré sobre veinte percento y ahora yo pruebo teclear en espanol cuando posible.)</p> <h2 id="back-to-regular-schedule">Back to regular schedule.</h2> <p>I am currently in Los Alamos, NM, for the next four weeks (in fact, I had exactly one day to repack my suitcase for Los Alamos hahah so I had very little transition time. It could be worse, I know people who have been going to conferences back to back even longer than I have). I expect to blog again right before I depart but so far internship work has been good and rewarding. I’ve had time to also do spare tasks for Georgia Tech, prepare for the semester, and write this blog post. But this conference (ECCO 2024) for sure will remain the highlight of my summer.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="travelling"/><category term="personal-update"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recalling my wonderful experience in Popayan, Colombia.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What A Year It’s Been</title><link href="https://danielyhwang.github.io/blog/2024/whatAYear/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What A Year It’s Been"/><published>2024-01-02T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-02T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://danielyhwang.github.io/blog/2024/whatAYear</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielyhwang.github.io/blog/2024/whatAYear/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2> <p>I did mean to blog the previous semester. I literally had a January 2023 blog post ready to go, but then I never got into it. While debating whether to code for a work project, I opened up VS Code and came back to this blog. I did miss updating this website. I was originally going to do a recap of 2022 back in 2023, but then I left this blog alone. Yikes. Anyways, I want to blog on a weekly basis for 2024. Especially since I’m almost out of the classes phase of the PhD. And also since I do creative projects on the side and tiny progress &gt; no progress. But let me recap the past 3 semesters real quick especially before the new semester ramps up.</p> <p>Apologies for no photos. I’ll add photos in the future but honestly I have not blogged in so long, I just to get <em>SOMETHING</em> out the door. But wow, I’ve had an amazing time so far with my graduate studies:</p> <h2 id="first-semester">First Semester</h2> <ul> <li>Moved from North Carolina to Atlanta!</li> </ul> <p>After completing a middle school camp counselor job and a brief vacation in Charleston, me and my family packed all of our stuff (I realized how much random stuff I have) and headed off to Atlanta! Despite the sweltering heat, I enjoyed my time with my new cohort and quickly made some friends on the basis of complaining about orientation.</p> <ul> <li>Try for Algebra comp, didn’t pass</li> </ul> <p>Eh, it was worth a shot, especially with GT’s policy.</p> <ul> <li>Take Algebra and Analysis I.</li> </ul> <p>Algebra helped me solidify concepts that my quarantined brain didn’t get as well the first time. I dreaded Analysis after a horrid experience with Baby Rudin, but I really enjoyed taking Real Analysis I with Shahaf Nitzan - her take on Lebesgue measurability was easy to follow and I learned a lot!</p> <ul> <li>Join way too many clubs.</li> </ul> <p>While I don’t remember too much from first semester in 2024, yeah, I jumped into a bunch of different academic institutions at Georgia Tech, including Humans vs Zombies, the Musician’s Network, and the CHEFS Culinary Club. I also participated in a bunch of social events courtesy of the Graduate Office.</p> <h2 id="second-semester">Second Semester</h2> <ul> <li>Try for Algebra comp again and Analysis comp, didn’t pass</li> </ul> <p>This time we established our semester-long tradition of going to Hattie B’s at the beginning of the semester. My spice tolerance is terrible for a Korean, but I still had a good time despite feeling uneasy about comps.</p> <ul> <li>Do a bunch of classes.</li> </ul> <p>Yeah, I got buried in coursework from Commutative Algebra, Complex Analysis, and Algebraic Topology, the latter being intensive for a student that did not know any topology outside of metric topology prior to entering GT. I’d say that class alone took half of my study time, but it was still worth it for the depth of knowledge. I still shudder when looking at anything homology or functor related.</p> <ul> <li>Begin to attend conferences.</li> </ul> <p>Attended Tech Topology Conference 2022 at GT, Joint Mathematics Meetings 2023 at Boston (I even met 3Blue1Brown!), AMS Sectional Southeastern 2023 at GT, ANYSRGMC 2023 at Syracuse, and Meeting on Applied Algebraic Geometry 2023 at GT. I still need to visit UGA (I’ve skipped out on 3 opportunities to go…)</p> <ul> <li>Begin to learn Korean?</li> </ul> <p>Since I had plans to visit Korea (at the cost of a fat 2500$ plane ticket), I spent some time practicing Korean via Korean Conversation Club and lessons at home, lessons I hope to continue in 2024, since I am nowhere near fluent yet.</p> <h2 id="summer">Summer</h2> <p>Most traveling I’ve ever done this summer:</p> <ul> <li>Visited my family and various spots across Korea, primarily Daegu. Also Seoul, Andong, Busan, Gyeongju. Ate way too much food and got my first real introduction to Korean drinking culture.</li> <li>Traveled to Los Alamos for an internship after taking 5 days to recover from jetlag.</li> <li>In Los Alamos, I watched Barbenheimer, visited my New Mexico friends I met at Syracuse in Albuquerque, visited my intern friend’s place of worship, camped in Colorado (3 days without a shower, never again), enjoyed some decent fireworks, found a math museum, found a board game shop, visited nearby Santa Fe, lost brutually in a tennis tournament, played some good volleyball, attended some cool local concerts, and cooked/ate some amazing food with my roommates. Oh yeah, and learned about Los Alamos’ history at the Bradbury Museum. There’s a rumor the Starbucks in Los Alamos is built on top of some nuclear ruins.</li> </ul> <h2 id="third-semester">Third Semester</h2> <ul> <li>Barely make it in time to Atlanta to try for Algebra and Topology comps. Passed Algebra, failed topology.</li> </ul> <p>Hattie B’s Round 2. Also met the new first-years.</p> <ul> <li>Wane down on extracurriculars.</li> </ul> <p>Given that I took on an organizational position, I had to cut down on the activities I could do this semester. I hope to rebounce now that the organizational position is over. I did go to DragonCon this year as Zenitsu from Demon Slayer!</p> <ul> <li>Start an affair with topology.</li> </ul> <p>I took knot theory and differential topology in hopes of learning if topology was for me. It’s not, but I learned a lot. Gave a new talk on the Conway knot, based off Jen Hom’s article on the same subject.</p> <ul> <li>Travel even more!</li> </ul> <p>Went to AMS Sectional Southeastern 2023 in Mobile, Alabama and CLSAC 2023 in Annapolis, Maryland. Along with local travel back to North Carolina, where I am writing this post.</p> <h2 id="hopes-for-2024">Hopes for 2024</h2> <p>I do have a lot of different goals and dreams, but they largely take on 5 categories:</p> <ul> <li>Math: I hope to finalize a research advisor and narrow down my research interests. This will obviously take the most time, but I hope to make enough time for the other 4 categories on this list.</li> <li>Self-Care: Given I’m still recovering from pandemic-induced anxiety, I hope to take more time to relax so I can be more present for my friends and family.</li> <li>Social Events: I hope to continue hosting and attending events with my friends.</li> <li>Exercise: I hope to continue weightlifting, tennis, and running, probably more on tennis.</li> <li>Comedy: I hope to perform more local sets. I have an ambitious goal to compile enough for an half hour at the end of the year, but I don’t want to jinx that.</li> <li>Miscellaneous Hobbies: Not sure how I’ll fit these in, but learning Korean, practicing Java game development (I need to just program something, anything, even if it’s not directly job-applicable), and playing the piano. Not sure if I can do these, but they’d be great if I could.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s to 2024.</p> ]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly"/><category term="yearly"/><category term="personal-update"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an Injury Reserve song, also a brief recollection of 2023]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Birth of a Blog!</title><link href="https://danielyhwang.github.io/blog/2022/birth_of_a_blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Birth of a Blog!"/><published>2022-12-27T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-27T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://danielyhwang.github.io/blog/2022/birth_of_a_blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielyhwang.github.io/blog/2022/birth_of_a_blog/"><![CDATA[<p>This post marks the opening of my blog titled “Notes of a Graduate Student”!

It does look nice. It’s also funny that I basically am spending winter break replacing the website I just made via <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu">sites.gatech.edu</a>, but I think using this template will have more benefits than my sites.gatech.edu website.
