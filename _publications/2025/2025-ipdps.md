  Resulting publication of Summer 2024 internship completed at <a href = "https://lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> under <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurammonroe">Laura Monroe</a>. We investigate a generalization of the Cartesian product on graphs called the star product and under certain conditions, carefully construct a maximal number of edge-disjoint spanning trees on it. Star products on graphs are ideal for network topologies, as they have low diameter, high scalability, and as our work shows, high parallelism.
