  We show that when integral polytopes are deformed while keeping the same facet normal vectors, the coefficients of weighted Ehrhart and h* polynomials are piecewise polynomial functions in the ``right-hand sides" of the linear inequalities defining the polytopes. We give an algorithm and an implementation in SageMath for computing these polynomials for smooth polytopes, such as type A alcoved polytopes, using a weighted Euler-Maclaurin type formula by Khovanskii and Pukhlikov.
