  Senior thesis (completed as part of the <a href="https://math.duke.edu/undergraduate/pruv/fellows">PRUV Program</a>) submitted for Graduation with Distinction, advised by <a href="https://margarethregan.com/">Margaret Regan</a>. This project utilized homotopy continuation, a technique from numerical algebraic geometry, to distinguish different regions of parameters of a parameterized polynomial system that yield different numbers of real positive steady states of the minimally bistable ERK network.
