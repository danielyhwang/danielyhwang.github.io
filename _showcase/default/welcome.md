    <h2>Welcome to Showcase!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        This personal page will be fully updated at a later time and serves as my page to talk about everything non-academic related!
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to entering academia, I was born in Daegu, South Korea, and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I am an improv and stand-up comedian who performs off and on-campus. I am currently affiliated with the Atlanta Stand-Up Comedy scene, Georgia Tech's improv comedy troupe <a href = "https://letstrythis.org">Let's Try This</a>, and serve as president of Stand Up Club at Georgia Tech (join our <a href = "https://discord.gg/xst4Ukxn8A">Discord</a> if interested!). I have performed in various venues in Atlanta, North Carolina, Berlin, and more. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also play board and video games, enjoy running and weightlifting, hang out with friends, and cook/eat good food. I try to do other things as well when I have the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        To contact me about anything comedy related, I am <a href = "https://instagram.com/four_eyes_iiii_nerd">four_eyes_iiii_nerd</a> on Instagram.

        <code>Showcase</code> is a page where you can show off almost anything you want. It can be the photo of your pets, your favorite books, your favorite projects, or anything else you want to show to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create a new showcase item by creating a new file in the <code>_showcase</code> folder. It gives you the highest flexibility to customize the item using any HTML code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cards are ordered by the <code>date</code> field in the front matter in descending order. The <code>width</code> field is used to determine the width of the card, ranging from 1 to 12.
        Layout is done by the <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a tidy layout, it is recommended to set the width of the cards to be either multiple of 3 or multiple of 4 for all cards, except for small badges that do not take up much space (width=1).
