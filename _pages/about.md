Hello! I'm a second-year Math PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://math.gatech.edu), with current interests in algebra & algebraic geometry.

I was born in Daegu, South Korea and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. Prior to attending Georgia Tech, I attended undergraduate at [Duke](https://duke.edu), where I completed my [senior thesis](https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/26428) under my undergraduate advisor [Margaret Regan](https://margaretregan.com).

Other than doing math, I write & perform stand-up comedy, play board & video games, enjoy running, weightlifting, and tennis, and scour seminars for free food. I also dabble in a bunch of other hobbies, most recently Java game development (which is my 2024 resolution).
