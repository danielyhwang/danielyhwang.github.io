    - title: PRUV Fellow and Independent Research
      institution: Duke University, Durham, North Carolina
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Advisor - Dr. Margaret Regan
        - title: Senior Thesis submitted for Graduation with Distinction.
          contents:
            - Researched how to maximize the number of solutions to a parameterized system corresponding to the steady states of the ERK biochemical network for various combinations of parameters.
            - Utilized homotopy continuation via Bertini to find the pseudo-witness set points of the discriminant locus, which separates the parameter space into distinct regions yielding the same number of real solutions.
            - Implemented MATLAB code that repeatedly samples over a 2-dimensional subspace of the parameter space to generate the discrete set of pseudo-witness set points for a given parameterization.
