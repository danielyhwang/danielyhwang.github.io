Oops, forgot to write this. Yeah. Last week was a lot. The past 10 days have been crazy. I hope they get less crazy but no guarantees on that front. I also exercised a lot towards the beginning of the week and by the end of the week I was sore and not wanting to move as much.

- Saturday 3rd: Try coding a side project, don't finish. Get groceries from Buford Highway and barely make it in time to watch Duke-UNC Game. Duke lost.
- Sunday 4th: Spent time at home. I don't really remember. Cook a lot of food.
- Monday 5th: Worked on logistics all day. Lord. That stressed me out.
- Tuesday 6th: Worked on tropical geometry homework. Played tennis. Felt better.
- Wednesday 7th: Worked on tropical geometry homework and sending a bunch of emails. Proctored a midterm.
- Thursday 8th: Worked on tropical geometry homework. Attended school's monthly dinner.
- Friday 9th: Worked on logistics all day. Jammed with some friends and got Knuckie's with some friends. Not good.
- Saturday 10th: Worked on logistics in the morning. Skip my morning run. Got groceries. Attend Lunar New Year party.
- Sunday 11th: Volunteer at church and get lunch back as a result. Walk around. My sore throat kicks in the afternoon. I skip watching the Super Bowl and watch The Bear season 1 finale instead.

At the Lunar New Year party, there was SO MUCH FOOD. We cooked an obscene number of dumplings, we drank some (non-)alcoholic cider, played Codenames, and generally had a good time. We also cooked some brisket, ribs, eggs, and Chinese sausage. Wow.

Being done with logistics and finally starting research! I'm scared to take the first leap but there is a paper [Enumerating Polytopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2012) that I do want to read. Also getting rid of this sore throat. Ugh. I'm skipping my workouts until it recovers.
