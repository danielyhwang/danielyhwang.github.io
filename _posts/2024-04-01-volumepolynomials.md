I forgot to write this last week! I had a wonderful spring break with my family in North Carolina, and now I'm back after a 8 hour drive (well, someone else did the driving). This past week I realized how much work I have to do, but it was pretty good nonetheless! Attended a talk by Frank Sottile, played a DnD game, hosted board game night, and even sang choir for a Good Friday service. This past weekend I hung out with my friends unexpectedly at Piedmont Park, made curry (way too salty), went to Easter Sunday service, and finally played some games.

Now that's over, I gotta do tropical geometry homework and even more than that, tropical geometry research (polytropes). Last week I read a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01920) and was fascinated that they were able to calculate the volume of a polytrope by creating a bijection betweeen polytropes and their corresponding toric ideals, along with additional tools such as the Tood operator. I'm focusing on writing my class report first, but am curious if this can be extended further to my problem of weighted Ehrhart theory.
