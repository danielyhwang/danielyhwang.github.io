 As I type this from my room, I stare at the suitcase and still think of all the clothes I gotta jam in there. But I am roughly 66% done and I hope to be done with everything soon. As I conclude this week, what did I do this week? Other than stress out... Sunday I mainly stayed at home, cleaned the house in a straight sweep, and planned out the bullet hell that was this week. Monday I met with advisor and drafted some new experiments. Then I worked out, went home, got groceries, and began planning. Tuesday I worked on a paper and then cooked fried rice, while stressing over plans related to my trip. Wednesday I finally had my last academic meeting of the week and finished my work, worked out, went home, called family, performed comedy, started packing, I started to feel better from the stress of Tuesday. Thursday I went to school in the morning, typed up my last document, went home, got new glasses, and completed more packing. Today I woke up, greeted a contractor, continued packing, spent time with other grad students (casually), went home, and am continuing packing. So this week has all been packing. But I know it'll be worth it and that I can take a breather before I do some math for two straight weeks. So to summarize, packing up definitely added a lot of stress on my plate, but I think it's almost over and I'm hoping to truly enjoy the rest of the summer.

 Tomorrow morning I'll make sure I didn't forget anything and then... I'll be on my way to Colombia. I'm hoping for a fun and safe trip ahead of me :D
