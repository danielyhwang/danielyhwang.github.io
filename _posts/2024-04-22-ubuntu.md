This is the last week of classes and I'm really dragging myself across the finish line. Monday and Tuesday I worked on the presentation for class, Wednesday I took off, Thursday I hosted board game night, played tennis, and struggled to set up WSL on my Windows machine. This is so I can run Macaulay2 and SageMath. Either way... damn. Ubuntu did not want to work with me.

Friday was much better, I had a decent studio (despite the fact my students were tired), I catched up on a bunch of emails and code, had a productive meeting, joined Grad Student Council, and had lunch with another grad student. Overall, good vibes.

Tomorrow is the Pi Mile 5K, and I really should not have ``warmed up" by running a 5K beforehand. Well, it was more like I ran, then walked a lot, then ran for a meeting I had with someone. Either way, I think my calves/feet are sore and I definitely screwed up. I'm looking forward to recuperating, especially on Sunday.

Next week I am FINALLY trying to clear out my stupid inbox, finalize summer plans, and hopefully begin analysis of Ehrhart polynomials on polytropes. The current thought process is ``no way this is Ehrhart positive... it's still useful to see if we can find any trends"
