The last day of classes was this Tuesday. Until then, I was kinda going about my normal business AND GETTING RID OF MY INBOX AGHHHH IT TOOK SO LONG TO DECLUTTER. It felt like I was dragging myself through routine classes and events. And then it was over.

Wednesday I got to go to a board game and make bossam (boiled pork wraps). I'm too lazy to upload a picture right now.

Thursday I stayed home, dealt with more emails, and did research in the evening while I waited for SageMath to download.

Friday I went to school, did research, met with my advisor, met with a fellow math theatre person, and had KBBQ for dinner.

Technically, I'm not done yet. But I'm very close to it. I have a plan and I plan to stick to it but my goal is to completely wrap up business before heading out of Atlanta.

Also she said yes! My advisor, that is. I now have an advisor!
