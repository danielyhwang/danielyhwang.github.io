WE'RE DONE! In terms of things we needed to get done, we finished edits to a class project paper, proctored and graded a final exam, and did some last minute research. I'm too tired to write anything else, I'm just going to chill until I depart for North Carolina on Saturday. Do my best to actually relax. I'm bad at it, just to clarify. I still got summer plans to do and emails to check, but I'll try to chill. 

Tomorrow is JadenFest, hosted by Jaden (and Will), the ultimate end-of-semester party, and I am pumped. I am also extremely tired and am trying to rest before the party. But I'm excited nonetheless to go to JadenFest and finally see family. You can assume that unless I post an update on this post, JadenFest IV went well.

I also took time to go to TopGolf, get some great Korean-Chinese food, went rock climbing, and cook myself some pasta.

I'm taking a one week break before jumping straight in again.
