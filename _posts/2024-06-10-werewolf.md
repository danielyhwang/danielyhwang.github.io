I came back from Philly last week. I spent Monday doing some cleaning, Tuesday through Thursday I worked on code to get more examples ready. Performed at Laughing Skull on Wednesday. I also read a spare paper for my internship. Friday I got lunch with friends and played board games. Saturday after reading my paper for my internship, I went to Manuel's Tavern and joined Werewolf ATL, a group that meets monthly to play, well, Werewolf. The game I joined got crazy, as everyone except a ``ghost" character died.

I also read the main outline from this [Handleman paper](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/pacific-journal-of-mathematics/volume-132/issue-1/Representing-polynomials-by-positive-linear-functions-on-compact-convex-polyhedra/pjm/1102689794.full) - he constructs a ring in which certain polynomials cannot appear - and thus proves that any polynomial that is positive over a compact polyhedron K must be a positive linear combination of the inequalities that define K.

Goals for this week are to pack up for Colombia, finish my work for my internship, finish my code for my research, and read Ch 11-12 Beck-Sinai. Bonus goals include reading about toric varieties and algebraic geometry.

Headed to Colombia for [ECCO 2024](https://ecco2024.combinatoria.co/) for the next two weeks and immediately afterwards to New Mexico!
