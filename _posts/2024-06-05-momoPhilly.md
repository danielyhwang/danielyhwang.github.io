So this summer has presented a lot of opportunities to meet people. I headed over to [MomoCon](https://momocon.com) on Memorial Day Weekend and let out my inner geek/nerd (in terms of fandom) for a few days before recovering on Monday. Last week, I mainly worked on code, attended a few talks from an online conference, performed a comedy set, and sent some grad council emails.

Over this past weekend, I headed over to [GTA Philadelphia](https://math.temple.edu/events/conferences/gscagt/) held at Temple, and I highly recommend it to other graduate students for a conference. Now that I'm back, there's always more coding, more notes, more papers to read. And this is my penultimate week to do so.
