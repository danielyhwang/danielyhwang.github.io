So I'll write these posts before leaving the office every week on Friday as my "farewell" to the office. I really hope with my new schedule that I won't have to come into the office on weekends. I plan to ask myself the same four questions:

1. What did you do this week?
2. What couldn't you do this week?
3. What are you looking forward to this weekend?
4. What are you looking forward to next week?

So here we go. It's 7:26PM and I'm super hungry so I'm making this extra fast.

1. Recuperate, come to Atlanta, revisit old topology exams and differential topology notes, also work on logistics for event I'm running.
2. The logistics for the event I'm running, saving for tomorrow morning.
3. Some time to relax at home and clean out my wardrobe.
4. Meeting everyone again, kicking off the new semester, starting off with classes and getting back into the swing of having events and things to do!
