The workload is starting to become normal, although one class in particular is starting to eat up my time. 
In good news, I passed Topology comp and am now done with comps! :D

1. What did you do this week?
Deal with a bunch of event logistics (Monday), work on tropical geometry homework (Tuesday/Wednesday) and analytic number theory homework (Monday, Friday). There were a bunch of evening events hosted by School of Mathematics and other clubs that kept me out the house majority of the time.
2. What couldn't you do this week?
Analytic number theory homework. That's due next week.
3. What are you looking forward to this weekend?
Enjoying the rain, hiking after the rain. Hanging out with friends at the bar (Friday).
4. What are you looking forward to next week?
Getting done with analytic NT homework. It may be because its Saturday and I just finished analytic NT that it's on my mind.
