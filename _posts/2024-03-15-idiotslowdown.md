High School Math Day finally happened! I'm free! Well... not exactly. This week I still found myself drowned in work. It's all over now but I need to remind myself to slow down and take it easy.

1. What did you do this week?
2. What couldn't you do this week?
3. What are you looking forward to this weekend?
4. What are you looking forward to next week?

I did a lot! After high school math day, I took some time at home to recover, but I still found myself coming to school on low levels of sleep doing seminars, makeup midterm proctoring, homeworks, teaching studios, catching up on emails, writing applications, and attending school events.

I barely did tropical geometry homework and research... I do have one paper to read once I'm back in Atlanta.

I am looking forward to Spring Break, seeing family, and recuperating at home.
