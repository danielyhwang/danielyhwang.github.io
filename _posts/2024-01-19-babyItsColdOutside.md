Yep, 2024 already starting off with the worst week so far. But I don't think anything else will top this. I hope I'm not jinxing myself. To be honest, this week wasn't the ABSOLUTE worst. But it was very cold outside, so when I went to work on Tuesday, I was not prepared. In fact, I was so ill-prepared that I caught a stomach bug for the rest of the week. So Tuesday afternoon I decided to ditch class because I was feeling super lethargic, Wednesday I stayed home, and after that... yeah I just did classes and met with the people I needed to. I also helped with my organizational role by hosting a small event for it on Thursday, an event that required more effort than I thought it would.

1. What did you do this week?
Recover from a stomachache, get started with some homework problems and research, reorganize a lot for my organizational role
2. What couldn't you do this week?
My organizational role. Well, there are some big tasks related to it that I'm pretty worried about.
3. What are you looking forward to this weekend?
Finally not having this stomach bug. I plan on staying in and recuperating.
4. What are you looking forward to next week?
Hopefully clearing out the major chunks of my organizational role, starting serious research, and knocking out homework assignments.
