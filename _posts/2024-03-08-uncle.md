I am now an uncle :D My niece was born last Friday and I am super excited to meet her :D

It's Friday morning and I am writing this even though my work is far from over. High School Math Day is tomorrow, so I'll be focused on that all today. And then it's tomorrow. And after that I take some relaxation.

1. What did you do this week?
2. What couldn't you do this week?
3. What are you looking forward to this weekend?
4. What are you looking forward to next week?

Non-stop logistical work. I wrote solutions, updated websites, and dealt with a lot of last week logistics. I am doing the rest I haven't done right now.

This weekend I am looking forward to hosting a wonderful High School Math Day before collapsing on my couch for the rest of the weekend. Next week I am looking forward to finishing up everything (and catching up on a month's worth of tropical geometry notes) next week, FINALLY starting research, and FINALLY going back home to North Carolina.
