So as hinted from my DC trip, I've been up to a lot ever since arriving back to Atlanta. I've been basically working on a class project nonstop from last Tuesday up until now. It took me a while to get my gears running and type... something, anything. In particular, yesterday, I spent a lot of time working to create a presentation on Beamer. And now it's here, it's beautiful, but... it took a LONG time. I actually don't remember anything else from last week (oh yeah, proctoring, but otherwise, it's been a grind).

But the presentation is tomorrow, so it will have all been worth it. And after tomorrow, my workload will be lighter (pretty much planning for the summer and miscellaneous tasks).

Other than working on the LaTeX/Beamer paper and presentation, I baked a carrot cake! It is attached below.
